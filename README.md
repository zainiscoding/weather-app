## Reflection

This project was built within the context of learning asynchronous JavaScript.

I set out to build a complete weather app that made use of current weather data.

This project was my first experience with asynchronous JavaScript. Implementing the fetching and displaying of data from the OpenWeather API was confusing at first. In retrospect, it's rather simple to do, but required a fair bit of study at the time. The styling of the carousel for the 8-day forecast also took some trial and error.

This project made use of React and the OpenWeather API in order to dynamically display asyonchronous data.
